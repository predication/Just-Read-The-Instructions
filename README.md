# Just-Read-The-Instructions

a very simple node.js/React.js website.  
 Probably some kind of database too.  
  And a REST-ful JSON API as well 
   because Hipsters gotta hip...

(Note: My prototype projects are normally named after A.I. spaceships from the Culture series of novels.)

## Initial Project Setup
* cloned the empty directory to local drive
* install a recent version of node.js (v6.10.0)
* terminal> npm init
* terminal> npm install --save react react-dom 
* terminal> sudo npm install -g create-react-app
* terminal> cd ~/github/Just-Read-The-Instructions
* terminal> create-react-app app
* (chug, chug, chug)
* terminal> cd app
* terminal> npm start

now project is running on http://localhost:3000/
